# Source
Folder for project source code, composed of back-end and front-end code. Given that the project is based on a
service-based architecture, files for both parts of the project are kept separate.

## Back-end
Files pertaining to the back-end implemenation. There are two main parts: a _Flask_ server implementing back-end services in separate endpoints, and a set of scripts relating to the _MongoDB_ database. This folder contains documentation about the installation of dependencies, execution of the back-end server, and the automated testing procedure.

## Front-end
Files pertaining to the user interface. Most of the front-facing code is implemented in Javascript using the *React* library. _Webserver_ configuration files will also reside in this folder. This folder contains documentation about the installation of dependencies and the execution of the server.
